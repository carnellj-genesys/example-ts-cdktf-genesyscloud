# example-ts-cdktf-genesyscloud
Example CDKTF/Typescript project that creates a queue and does an export using CX as Code.  This code is as-is and is mean to show the output of using the CDKTF.  Including the terraform state files (which I normally wouldnt do), but a forum question asked to see them.
